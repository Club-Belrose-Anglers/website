## Our Story "Club Belrose Anglers, originally known as Parkway Pirates Fishing Club, was founded in 2003 with a vision to

establish a community-centric fishing club. Initially associated with The Parkway Hotel, our club
was a place for enthusiasts to share their passion for fishing. After the Parkway Hotel's renovation
and subsequent changes in 2019, we found a new home at Club Belrose. This transition marked a new
chapter in our history, leading to our rebranding as 'Club Belrose Anglers'. Today, we continue to
thrive, embracing our legacy while forging new paths in the vibrant setting of Sydney's Northern
Beaches."

## Our Mission

"At the core of Club Belrose Anglers is our mission to create a safe, fun environment where the love
of fishing is passed on to the next generation. We're not just about casting lines; we're about
building friendships, sharing knowledge, and enjoying life's simple pleasures together."

## Milestones and Achievements

### Community Spirit

"Over the years, our club has not only focused on fishing but also on giving back. We've proudly
supported families dealing with serious health conditions, organizing annual fundraising drives and
involving our entire community in these heartfelt initiatives."

### Global Footprint

"Our love for fishing and community took us on an unforgettable journey to Fiji. There, we embraced
the local culture, shared resources with a village in need, and forged memories that exemplify the
spirit of our club."

## Leadership and Legacy

"Guy 'Woody' Ward, our President from 2009 to 2023, has been the backbone of our club. Taking the
helm during challenging times, Woody's leadership and dedication have been instrumental in shaping
the club into the thriving community it is today. His commitment to our values and members is the
true embodiment of what Club Belrose Anglers stands for."
