## Welcome to Club Belrose Anglers

🌊 Located on Sydney's stunning Northern Beaches, we're more than just a fishing club - we're a
community.

🏆 Dive into monthly competitions with a changing fish of the month - from Salmon to Luderick,
there's always a new challenge!

🍻 Join us at [Club Belrose](www.clubbelrose.com.au), our vibrant home base! Boasting live music,
delicious dining, and Saturday night meat tray raffles!

✈️ Journey with us on unforgettable trips: be it racing jet-boats in Fiji, catching Marlin in
Vanuatu, or swimming with Crocs in Cairns... Our adventures are packed - like providing heartwarming
aid to Fiji's villages or treating resort staff to a Mahi Mahi feast... And if the 'Flathead
Challenge' calls... Forster to Lake Macquarie, Port Stephens to Greenwell Point await!

🎉 Every event is a celebration: Monthly BBQ's at the competition weigh-ins, presentation nights
bursting with raffles, and yes, Santa might pop by at our Xmas Weigh-In!
